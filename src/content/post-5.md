Failure is an opportunity to learn<!-- end --> yet, despite that, we've conditioned ourselves to avoid failure at all cost.

We've learnt to have a negative attitude/emotion and conversly reaction towards failure.

In fact, we're not improving the situation since we're still imposing the same idea on future generations.

It's time for a mindset shift.

Let's embrace failure as we've always embraced success because failure is part of the process.

Everytime we fail, let's congratulate ourselves and consider the lessons as an opportunity to grow.

As long as the failure isn't catastrophic, we'll always recover each time a little better than before but only if we embrace failure and learn from it.

Therefore...

Fail fast, fail often.

> The rule is simple: The person who fails the most will win. If I fail more than you do, I will win. Because in order to keep failing, you've got to be good enough to keep playing. <span style="display:block;text-align:right;"><em>- Seth Godin</em></span>
