Time is our most limited resource <!-- end --> yet we rarely pay attention to how we consume it.

Sometimes we give it away for "free" and other times we loose track of it.

It's no coincidence that we rely on the phrase "spend time" because that's literally what we're all doing.

But time is finite. At least from our perspective, experience and interpretation of it. Once you spend it, it's gone.

So why not spend it on something of equal or exceding value? Afterall isn't that how trade fundamentally works?
