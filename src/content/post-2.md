A process is a systematic approach to task execution.

It's fairly easy to underestimate the value of a process however,
having a process enables predictability and transparency which minimizes assumptions and builds trust.

A clearly defined process promotes efficiency and productivity.

The effectiveness of a process can be enhanced by improving awareness.

Why awareness?

Because improved awareness enables accountability.

If something occurs unexpectedly within the process, it's fairly simple to identify and diagnose the issue. But all that is dependent on awareness.

Ideally, the goal is to document the process to make it accessible and reproducible.

In a way, documenting or writing it down also makes it "real" in the sense that it can be viewed objectively.
